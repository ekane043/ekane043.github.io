<h2>Luther and my goals<h2>
<p> The main goal for my attending Luther is to get a degree. Simple enough. I want to major in computer science and Biology
but from what I can tell that is one goal that may be a little to much for me to accomplish but I'm goin all in. Biology 
is coming back to me easy enough the only thing I hate is we have to take math I'm not exactly great at math. 
But it counts for both cs and bio. Computer Science is proving to be time consuming but I really love the hands on learning.
I learned how to do most of this stuff from experimentation and asking the professor what to do every once in a while.
I have a feeling this will be a great four years at Luther if I stick with it.</p>
